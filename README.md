# QEMU Fault Tool

A QEMU based tool to achieve exhaustive fault injection on various targets. This tool aim to support as much target as possible. Currently supported architectures are those supported by QEMU (ARM, i386/x86-64, MIPS, PowerPC, RISCV32/64, AVR ...).

## Prerequisites

In order to build QEMU you need to install some packages. This can be done with the following command:

```shell
$ sudo apt install build-essential bison flex gcc-arm-none-eabi git libcapstone-dev libfdt-dev libglib2.0-dev libpixman-1-dev ninja-build zlib1g-dev python3-rich python3-tqdm python3-venv python3-yaml
```

## Compilation

Clone this repository:

```shell
$ git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/shml1n/qemu-fault-tool.git
```

Compile QEMU:

```shell
$ cd qemu
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ ../configure
$ make -j $(nproc)
```

## Usage

### The VerifyPin example

**Optional**: To compile the program by yourself simply use the following commands

```shell
$ cd example/verifyPin
$ make
```

Faulting the PIN comparison can be achieved with the following command line:

```shell
$ python3 multicore_qemu_fault.py -fw 3635 -a 0x800028c -fa 0x800029a -ea 0x80002ea -erra 0x8000408 -ito 3635 -fm skip example/verifyPin/verifyPin.elf
```

**Note**: if you compiled the program by yourself the addresses may differ based on your cross compilation toolchain version.

### The U-Boot example

Before faulting U-Boot you have to uncomment the following lines in `config.yaml`:

```yaml
# Uncomment this to fault u-boot
# qemu_executable_path: "qemu/build/qemu-system-aarch64"
...
# Uncomment this to fault u-boot
# qemu_options: "-M virt -cpu cortex-a57 -m 24M"
```

Faulting the U-Boot password comparison can then be achieved with the following command line:

```shell
$ python3 multicore_qemu_fault.py -fw 800000 -a 0x417675f8 -fa 0x4175ec9c -ea 0x41765f70 -erra 0x41765f70 -ito 800000 example/u-boot/bootloader.bin -bios
```

**Note**: Addresses were found using the Ghidra decompiler.
